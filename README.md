The Data Model That Reveals Your True Profit Margin
This isn't some academic diagram. This is a war machine of analytics designed for delivery businesses that are serious about profit.

It answers the critical questions that are costing you money right now:

WHICH client, WHICH sector, and WHICH vehicle type is making you the most moneyâ€”and which ones you need to cut loose.

The real performance rating of every driver and the actual impact of seniority (Does experience really matter?).

The unvarnished truth about your Delivery Delays and your true hourly Productivity.

This system connects your raw delivery data (fact_deliveries) with the key dimensions (Clients, Drivers, Vehicles, Time) to isolate and measure every single cost and revenue factor.

The result? A dashboard (Measures_Dashboard) packed with brutal performance metrics (Delay Rate, Productivity by Account) that tells you EXACTLY where to hit to increase speed and stop the bleeding.

This is the intelligence you need to dominate your market.
